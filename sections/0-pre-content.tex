\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to express my thanks to my supervisor Prof. Egor Babaev at KTH. Dr. Siril Yella at Rumbline Consulting for structure and feedback on my report. Per Ininbergs at Rumbline Consulting for support and motivation. Wile Balkhed and Viktor Nilsson for supervising in general time management and thesis writing. 

Mostly I would like to thank my supervisor Emil Blomquist at KTH for giving me this oppurtunity and the hard work put in to start-off and explore in a new direction.
