\chapter{Results}

The results gathered are from a randomly initialized RNN on the dataset MNIST. A mini-batch consists of $1000$ samples, as the HF relies on bigger mini-batches. An epoch is a complete progression of mini-batches through the entire dataset, of which there are in total $60 000$. Of the total set, however, a selection set of $10 000$ samples was used, which makes the training set $50000$. A total of $11$ epochs was performed on one training run. Finally a test set of $10000$ samples benchmarked the RNN.

For the changes in the RNN, a relaxation function $e(5/(2x)) - 1$ where $x$ is the current epoch, was used to regulate changes and make them less probable as the training progresses.
